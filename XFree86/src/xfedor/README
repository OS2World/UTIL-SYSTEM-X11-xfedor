Sat Nov  7 00:02:59 MET 1998    xfedor-5.0.1

This is a slightly hacked version of xfedor-5.0 from 07/91.

Following things are modified:

    - Support for direct/truecolor displays.
    - Initial support for the window manager's close button.
    - SegFault in Rast_Init fixed.
    - Some minor cleanups.

To do:
    - The colormap doesn't make much sense on direct and truecolor
      displays.
    - Close button not handled at all places.
    - Some of the tools work ... hmmm ...  strange.
    - ...
    - Translate the whole sh^Htuff from french to english :-/

Install:
    - Check paths in Makefile
    - make
    - Test it: SOS=Sosa ./xfedor -f fkp2.bdf
    - make install
    - The man page is preformatted.  You have to install it by
      hand in the right place.

Please look at README.orig for comments from the original
author (Daniel Dardailler) and note the Copyright (BSD-like).

I added the fixed width sample font fkp2.bdf from ???.
