Xfedor is a bdf/xbm/xpm/mouse editor.
It has been achieved before Xt or Motif were available, so it is only
based on Xlib :-|

If I was to re-write it, I would certainly use Xt and Motif.

Known problems:
      - very very old proprietary look&feelsick
      - comments in french
      - filer.c module (BDF reader/writer) has to be reviewed for new BDF
        stuff and some bugs (COMMENT lines lost, unexpected changes in
        read/write only actions...)
      - non Xt based => icccm problems, fixed geometry, lack of resources...
      - not even X based originally, so don't expect something great.
      - no Imakefile

Otherwise, It can still help to create mouse cursors, colored pixmaps and
possibly fonts (if you don't care about XLFD compliance at first).

Xfedor needs the Xpm library found on export to link and create xpm
pixmap files.
