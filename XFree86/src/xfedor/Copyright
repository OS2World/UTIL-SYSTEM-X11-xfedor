What is really meaned by this copyright is that:

The distribution of XFEDOR is publicly available, but is
NOT in the public domain.  The difference is that copyrights granting rights
for unrestricted use and redistribution have been placed on all of the
software to identify its authors.  

GROUPE BULL and Daniel Dardailler let you use XFEDOR as long as you do
not pretend to have written it or try to make money out of it, except 
for porting the code.
